General thoughts
- should try to focus on swarm control vs individual asset control

Specific User Goals
- search for adversaries
- neutralize adversaries

ImGui thoughts
- create tcm by drawing box, then filling out tcm parameter popup and adjusting points
	- reselecting for editing should still allow you to change the tcm type
	- everything should be able to have a label
- creating ttp, draw gesture or drag n drop
	- might lack a tcm, should be able to click the lacking indicator to pop it in and adjust
- failed ttps don't provide any feedback about why they failed
- should provide info about where an asset is headed and its intent (nav vs engage)
- task status counter
	- maybe could add some interactions for new visuals
	- maybe move this? i like the column view tho
- side bar w/ icons to toggle visuals of different libs (map layers, task tree, agent stuff)
	- production version of the dev options
- add a compass?

ATAK Thoughts
- plugin
	- start with plugin to gain familiarity
