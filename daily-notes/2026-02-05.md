**Veg Control**
- 3 control modes
	- autonomous
	- ==teleoperated==
		- ==control the weed out tool head in a "manual" fashion remotely==
	- learning
		- would need to be able to train off of data (maybe from the manual teleoperations)
		- isaac lab stuff here too?
- consider what rights we are delivering things to them with (rise vs tempo etc.)
- software needs more work, hardware is pretty much just making it pretty and making things rugged
	- needs to be updated with most recent tempo
		- also needs to be brought into a central release
	- ==waypoint path tracking, could also use for search memory?==
		- ==first step of heatmap / fog of war==
		- ==could also be related to historical trails==
	- ==visualize camera fulstrum==
	- ==ui scaling==
	- ==needs a map==
	- ATR aylmao
		- ultralytics zeroshot model as starting point

**ARL / AWE**
- continuation of RAAIT effort from AUKUS 
- 5 missions, 3 well defined
	- mission 3 is more complicated, truck will move, need follow
		- drones and operator start from different locations

		- task new agent or switch task and retask original search
	- mission 5 network degradation
- max of 5 drones
	- black widows from TEAL
