Scrum
- waiting for CICD to copmlete to merge initial approved notifications PR that just adds the class outlines
- will probably make one for a utility icons class
	- general use ones like info/warning/error as well as the rise logo
- working on the panel visual

what was i doing just now
- noticed the agents and task cnt panels overlapping, seeing when i fked that up
- JUST BUILT WITH RESETTING AFTER MERGING TO FIRST NOTIFS OUTLINES PR
- also reset to before that PR and its still overlapping, maybe just a caching thing?
